# Advanced RAG Methods

- **Retrieval Challenges**: Why retrieval often fails in enterprise RAG setups and easy-to-advanced methods to improve retrieval quality, from query rewriting to GraphRAG and fine-tuned retrievers

- **Debugging RAG Failures**: How to debug and fix common RAG failures using structured strategies and examples drawn from real-world use cases

- **Memory Implementation**: How different types of memory (working, episodic, semantic, procedural) can be implemented in agents to mimic human-like behavior

- **Self-Improving Agents**: The role of memory in enabling self-improving agents, including the use of feedback loops like the Reflexion framework
