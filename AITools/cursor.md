- Simply keep pressing **Tab** to complete logical steps quickly.

### 🧩 3. Context Awareness
- Cursor understands your **entire codebase**.  
- Unlike other platforms, you don’t need to copy/paste code — it already knows your context.

### 🧠 4. Agentic Composer (the magic!)
Cursor’s **Agentic Composer** allows you to describe your goal, and it will:
- Identify relevant files and snippets.  
- Generate **inline diffs** for your review.  
- Reference documentation automatically in your prompt.  
- Provide precise updates while keeping human-in-the-loop control.

### 🔍 5. Choice of Models
- Cursor supports multiple AI models.
- We recommend **Claude Sonnet 4** for optimal balance between speed and reasoning.  
- The **default free model** is **GPT-4o**, which works well too.  
- You can change the model anytime in settings.
