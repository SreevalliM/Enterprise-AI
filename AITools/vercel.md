## 🧠 Overview

**Vercel v0** is an AI-powered pair programmer that empowers anyone to prototype and build on the web, regardless of technical expertise. It can generate **full-stack apps**, and while similar to Cursor, it’s far superior for **quickly building prototypes** because you can **see the UI as you build**.

The best part? These prototypes can be hosted as **live websites with one click**, or you can **clone the generated code** to host it yourself.

## ✨ Why We Love Vercel v0

Vercel v0 can:

* Generate and deploy full-stack web applications.
* Integrate with **Figma** to generate code from existing designs.
* Clone a screenshot or website to **generate UI in a similar style**.
* Enable quick website creation — perfect for personal sites or blogs.

We often use **v0** for simple websites since we don’t have extensive web development experience.
