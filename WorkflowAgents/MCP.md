# MCP Introduction & What it Enables

Since you already have a solid understanding of tool-calling from the core lectures, here’s a link to our April lightning session on building agentic AI apps in 2025.

We’ve covered many related parts, but for a good introduction to MCP, start watching from the 14-minute mark to around 25 minutes. We’ve got a lot more content and workshops on MCP and protocols, but this should be a useful intro now that you’ve just picked up tool-calling.
