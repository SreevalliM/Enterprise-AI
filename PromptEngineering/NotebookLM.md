# NotebookLM for Reading Prompt Engineering Research

If you've been wanting to read and understand research papers, prompt engineering papers are the perfect place to start! They are easier to digest, help build the habit of reading research, and teach you how to think critically about AI advancements.

Most practitioners read research to understand its practical impact (and what it means to them) so here's our fast-track mechanism to read prompt engineering papers.

### Extract and summarize key insights based on the following questions:

#### Approach Overview

* What is the core idea of the method?
* Provide a few examples of how it works in practice.

#### Categorization

* Does this method fall under thought generation/reflection, decomposition, or ensemble prompting?
* If not, describe the category it belongs to and explain why.

#### Datasets Used

* What datasets were used for evaluation?
* Briefly describe each dataset and its relevance to testing the method.

#### Performance & Comparisons

* How does this method perform compared to baseline models or existing approaches?
* What models were used for comparison?
* What metrics were used? Explain these metrics
* What types of tasks is this method suitable for? (e.g., reasoning, summarization, retrieval, translation)

#### Cost & Latency Considerations

* If implemented, how would this method impact cost and latency compared to using a standard prompt?
* Would it require additional compute, API calls, or fine-tuning?

#### Notable Insights

* Are there any unexpected findings, limitations, or surprising results?
* Did the method show unique strengths or weaknesses?

#### Additional Considerations

* Does this approach generalize across different tasks, or is it domain-specific?
* Are there any ethical or robustness concerns?
