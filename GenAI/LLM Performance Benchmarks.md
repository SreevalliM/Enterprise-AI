# ðŸ“Š LLM Performance Benchmarks

## Overview
With the rapid growth of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, benchmarking has become essential to:

- Measure model performance  
- Ensure reliability  
- Facilitate fair comparisons  

Benchmarks help developers understand capabilities across tasks like language understanding, reasoning, coding, and conversational skills.  

> Benchmarks may use **static datasets** or **live queries**, and scoring methods can be **ground-truth-based** or **human-preference-based**.

## Categories of LLM Benchmarks

1. **Language Understanding & Question Answering (QA)** â€“ Comprehension, retrieval, factual accuracy  
2. **Reasoning & Commonsense** â€“ Logical inference, problem-solving, real-world knowledge  
3. **Coding** â€“ Code generation, completion, understanding  
4. **Conversation & Chatbots** â€“ Multi-turn dialogue coherence and engagement  
5. **Other Specialized Benchmarks** â€“ Truthfulness, math reasoning, translation, logical deduction  

Benchmarks are also classified by:

- **Question Source:** Static vs. Live  
- **Evaluation Method:** Ground truth-based vs. Human preference-based
