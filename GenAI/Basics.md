# ðŸ§  [Grow] Understanding Deep Learning, Neural Networks & LLM Architecture

## Overview
To understand how **LLMs** work, it's important to first grasp **neural networks** and **deep learning**, which in turn require a solid foundation in **machine learning**.

> While deep knowledge isnâ€™t required for most AI roles, itâ€™s essential for modifying model architectures or building models from scratch. Most companies today leverage prebuilt models, so strong **application-level knowledge** is often sufficient.

Think of it like understanding how the web works vs. using the web to build online businesses. AI is now reaching a similar level of pervasiveness.

## Learning Roadmaps

### Long Learning Roadmap (80â€“100+ hours)
Recommended for a **deep understanding of LLMs**:

1. **Machine Learning** â€“ Builds the foundation for deep learning  
   - [Andrew Ngâ€™s Machine Learning Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)

2. **Deep Learning** â€“ Essential for understanding neural networks  
   - [Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)

3. **NLP Basics** â€“ Covers RNNs, transformers, and attention  
   - [Stanford CS224N - NLP with Deep Learning](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/)

4. **LLM Architecture and Training** â€“ Covers large-scale model training and fine-tuning  
   - [Stanford CS25 - Transformers United](https://cs25.github.io/)

5. **Building LLMs from the Ground Up** â€“ A 3-hour coding workshop  
   - [Workshop Link](https://www.example.com/llm-workshop) *(replace with actual link if available)*

> This path is recommended for those who want to understand LLMs **under the hood**.

### Shorter Learning Roadmap (2â€“3 hours)
For a **practical, application-level understanding** of LLMs and transformers:

- [Jay Alammarâ€™s Illustrated Transformers](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/)  
- [Andrej Karpathyâ€™s Video on LLM Training â€“ LLMs: Training & Fine-Tuning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY)  
- [Illustrating Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) â€“ HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/blog/rlhf)

> This shorter path wonâ€™t make you an ML or deep learning expert but gives a solid grasp of LLMs for practical use.
